# Crossroad Simulation with POSIX Threads and Scheduling Algorithms in C.

## Description
This project is a simulation of a crossroad with regular cars and police cars, lights etc. It is implemented using multiple POSIX threads and scheduling algorithms. Moreover, there are special cases that interrupts monotonity of scheduling. It is a fun project to experiment with new concepts. You can see the readme file and log files for more information.
